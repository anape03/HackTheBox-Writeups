## Enumeration

We have the machine IP.\
Through an nmap scan we see the following:
```bash
$ nmap -p- -sV -sC -T4 10.10.11.13

```

We will also try some (sub)directory fuzzing.

I tried a few different wordlists, but I couldn't find anything.

The `runner.htb` website doesn't seem too interesting, only having a basic home page, though mentioning 2 employees, which might be useful sometime later.

So I tried using `cewl`:
```bash
$ cewl http://runner.htb -w wordlist.txt
```

```bash
$ gobuster vhost -u http://runner.htb -w wordlist.txt --append-domain

## TeamCity web UI

Accessing the website, we are greeted with a login page:\
![TeamCity page](images/Runner-TeamCity-page.png) 

Online, we find `CVE-2023-42793`:
> In JetBrains TeamCity before 2023.05.4 authentication bypass leading to RCE on TeamCity Server was possible

We will be using [H454NSec's exploit](https://github.com/H454NSec/CVE-2023-42793) to create an admin user:
```bash
$ python3 CVE-2023-42793.py -u http://teamcity.runner.htb
```

In the admin panel, we find a `users` page which might be useful later:\
![users page in administration panel](images/Runner-TeamCity-users.png)

Along with that, we see the `backup` page:\
![backup page in administration panel](images/Runner-TeamCity-backup.png)

We see that creating a backup includes a database too! We create a backup, and download the `.zip` file.

## Cracked hashes

Inside we find this:
```
ID, USERNAME, PASSWORD, NAME, EMAIL, LAST_LOGIN_TIMESTAMP, ALGORITHM
1, admin, $2a$07$neV5T/BlEDiMQUs.gM1p4uYl8xl8kvNUo4/8Aja2sAWHAQLWqufye, John, john@runner.htb, 1719857944579, BCRYPT
2, matthew, $2a$07$q.m8WQP8niXODv55lJVovOmxGtg6K/YPHbD48/JQsdGLulmeVo.Em, Matthew, matthew@runner.htb, 1709150421438, BCRYPT
11, admin.ilsp, $2a$07$5KCbvTBQB7Jtca6o067A9u/ZwAwlXonaA5d.5WLXA.r.szqHi/YDu, , admin.Ilsp@lol.omg, , BCRYPT

```

We will try to crack these hashes.
```bash
$ hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 -o cracked.txt bcrypt_hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

We were able to find Matthew's login credentials: `matthew:piper123`\
Trying to use the password to connect through ssh didn't seem to work.

## SSH

Looking some more around the files we find a private key in the config folder, and judging from a config file it looks like it's Matthew's! I tried to connect as Matthew using the private key, but that didn't seem to work, perhaps it's someone else's key.\
I tried using the username `john` (the admin name found earlier), and that finally worked!
```bash
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
$ ssh john@runner.htb -i id_rsa
```

We now find the user flag in our home directory.

## Looking around

I found `matthew` in the `/home` directory as well, but I couldn't switch user using the password I found.

Using `linpeas` I noticed this:\
![linpeas: Unexpected in /opt](images/Runner-linpeas-opt.png)

And then later also this:\
![linpeas: Hostname, hosts and DNS](images/Runner-linpeas-hostname-host-DNS.png)

## Portainer administration

Accessing `portainer-administration.runner.htb` from our machine we see this login page:\
![Portainer administration login page](images/Runner-portainer-admin-page.png)

This time looks like we could get to use Matthew's earlier found credentials!

Here we find our portainer version at the bottom of the page:\
![portainer version](images/Runner-portainer-version.png)

## Privilege Escalation

I found online [this article for privilege escalation in Portainer](https://rioasmara.com/2021/08/15/use-portainer-for-privilege-escalation/).

This article is from 2021, so it seems to be using an older version with a few different options than the "current" one we have here, but we'll make it work.

First of all, we need to create a Volume.

However `Path` was apparently not an acceptable value, so we will be using these options, as found [on a stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71734166/mount-a-directory-from-docker-container-to-the-linux-ubuntu-host-machine):\
![Portainer: create volume](images/Runner-portainer-Volume.png)

We will be using this existing image:\
![Portainer: Images](images/Runner-portainer-Images.png)

Now we create our container:\
![Create container: name and image](images/Runner-portainer-Create-Container-1.png)

With the following options:\
![Create container: Advanced - Command and logging](images/Runner-portainer-Create-Container-2.png)\
![Create container: Advanced - Volumes](images/Runner-portainer-Create-Container-3.png)

We deploy our container, go to `console`, and connect to get root flag!
